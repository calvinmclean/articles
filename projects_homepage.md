# Projects

I enjoy working on programming projects in my free time to learn new things and build tools that are useful in my regular life.

These are some of my side projects that I am particularly proud of. Check out [my GitHub](https://github.com/calvinmclean) to see all of my projects!

* [`automated-garden`: Weather-aware open irrigation controller](projects/automated_garden.md)
* [`article-sync`: CLI and GitHub Action to sync articles from this repostory to Dev.to](projects/article_sync.md)
