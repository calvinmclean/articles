This repository will eventually contain some more information about myself, my interests, and experience.
Currently, it just contains articles that I have written.

It uses my [`article-sync`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/article-sync) GitHub Action to post these articles to [DEV](https://dev.to/calvinmclean).
