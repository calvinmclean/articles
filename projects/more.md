# Additional Projects

These are some other projects that I have built. I'm still very proud of these projects, but want to point more attention to the other ones with dedicated pages.


## Event RSVP

This is a web-app implemented using `babyapi` and is included in the repository as an example. 

The application allows for simple management of event invites and RSVPs using links and an admin dashboard. An Event is created with a password so only the owner can modify it. Then, an Invite includes a unique identifier to identify the RSVPer and grant them read-only access to the Event.


## Survey

I created this project when learning [Gleam](https://gleam.run), a fun and friendly functional programming language. This library allows users to easily create rich and interactive prompts in the terminal.


## Tic Tac Go

Tic Tac Go is a tic tac toe game implemented using Go and HTMX. It uses server-sent events to enable multiplayer without websockets. Simply share the link with a friend to have them join your game.


## Homebridge Kettle
[![homebridge-kettle](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/calvinmclean/homebridge-kettle)

This is a homebridge integration + python API for interacting with the older Fellow Stagg EKG+ smart kettle using bluetooth. It allows controlling the kettle as a thermostat and I use it automatically start heating up water for my morning coffee.


## Gnotes

Gnotes is a simple program to create weekly notes in a structured format. I use this to keep myself organize and have a note-taking system with low overhead so I can focus on getting things done.
